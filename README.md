This project showcases how to build and train a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to perform image classification on the popular **CIFAR-10** dataset using Python and deep learning libraries such as **TensorFlow** or **PyTorch**.

The **CIFAR-10** dataset consists of **60,000 32x32 color images** across **10 distinct classes**, including objects like airplanes, cars, birds, cats, and more. It is widely used for benchmarking image classification algorithms.

 Key Features:

 **Data Preprocessing:**
  The images are normalized and optionally augmented (e.g., flipping, rotation) to improve generalization.

 **Model Architecture:**
  A CNN architecture is built with multiple convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers. Common components include:

  * Convolutional layers for feature extraction
  * Max-pooling layers for downsampling
  * Dropout for regularization
  * Dense layers for classification

 **Training & Evaluation:**
  The model is trained using an optimizer like Adam and loss function like categorical crossentropy. Performance is evaluated using accuracy and a confusion matrix on the test set.

 **Results:**
  The final model is capable of classifying unseen images into one of the 10 categories with high accuracy.

This project is a great introduction to computer vision and deep learning, demonstrating how CNNs can learn complex patterns in image data for effective classification.
